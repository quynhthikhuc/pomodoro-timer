# pomodoro-timer
Pomodoro timer is a time management method that helps to maximize productivity and avoid procrastination by using a work-reward model: each 25-minute work interval (which is also referred to as a Pomodoro) is rewarded with a 5-minute break, and every four Pomodoros is rewarded with a 15-minute break.
